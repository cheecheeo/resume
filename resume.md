    - Contributed to [Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) Twitter's monolithic repository build system.
    - Working as a member of the platform intelligence team I contributed to [TSAR](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2014/tsar-a-timeseries-aggregator.html) the Time Series AggregatoR. During my time on Platform Intelligence I also took the opportunity to contribute to the [Algebird](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2014/tsar-a-timeseries-aggregator.html) project TSAR relied upon for its probabilistic data structures. TSAR was eventually superseded by Apache Spark.
    - On the [chargeback](https://www.linux.com/blog/twitters-chargeback-system-measures-resource-use-and-sends-out-bill) team at Twitter I co-architected a datawarehouse to store facts related to CPU and RAM usage, and user and service identification. Additionally, I built a simple data gathering system that extracted, transformed, and loaded raw chargeback-related data from a diverse population of systems in the chargeback data warehouse.
