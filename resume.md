Work Experience
---------------

*   **Word Processor** (Redmond, WA)

    Junior Resumé Maker, 2006 - 2007

    -   Intermingled presentation and content
    -   Styling was a pain, so either didn't do it or found a half-decent
        template and didn't mess with it

*   **\LaTeX\ + pdflatex**

    Senior Resumé Maker, 2008 - 2010

    -   Edited verbose \LaTeX\ documents in a text editor
    -   Mixed content and presentation to achieve pixel-perfection
    -   Installed and configured the unusual TeX setups required by the
        best-looking \LaTeX\ resumés

*   **LinkedIn, StackOverflow Careers, vizualize.me, etc**

    Web Resumé Intern, August 2010

    -   Entered data, adapting to different data models and formatting
        limitations
    -   Attempted to customize PDF exports and remove default resumé elements,
        to no avail

*   **Markdown with Pandoc**

    Resumé Architect, February 2011 - present

    -   Write in one format (Markdown), convert to many formats (PDF, HTML, ODT,
        DOCX, and more)
    -   Style HTML output with CSS and PDF output with a custom \LaTeX\ header
    -   Use a simple pre-processor to define per-format operations on the
        Markdown input or its parts, such as moving contact information to the
        top right of the page in both HTML and PDF output.
    -   Use a text-based resumé when needed in a pinch
    -   Use version control, including free hosting on Github
