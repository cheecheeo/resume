Interests
---------

*   Programming languages. Understanding abstractions, applying them in practice. Writing simple code.


Professional Experience
---------------

*   **Word Processor** (Redmond, WA)

    Junior Resumé Maker, 2006 - 2007

    -   Intermingled presentation and content
    -   Styling was a pain, so either didn't do it or found a half-decent
        template and didn't mess with it

*   **\LaTeX\ + pdflatex**

    Senior Resumé Maker, 2008 - 2010

    -   Edited verbose \LaTeX\ documents in a text editor
    -   Mixed content and presentation to achieve pixel-perfection
    -   Installed and configured the unusual TeX setups required by the
        best-looking \LaTeX\ resumés

*   **LinkedIn, StackOverflow Careers, vizualize.me, etc**

    Web Resumé Intern, August 2010

    -   Entered data, adapting to different data models and formatting
        limitations
    -   Attempted to customize PDF exports and remove default resumé elements,
        to no avail

*   **Markdown with Pandoc**

    Resumé Architect, February 2011 - present

    -   Write in one format (Markdown), convert to many formats (PDF, HTML, ODT,
        DOCX, and more)
    -   Style HTML output with CSS and PDF output with a custom \LaTeX\ header
    -   Use a simple pre-processor to define per-format operations on the
        Markdown input or its parts, such as moving contact information to the
        top right of the page in both HTML and PDF output.
    -   Use a text-based resumé when needed in a pinch
    -   Use version control, including free hosting on Github

Research
---------------
* **Portland State University, Department of Computer Science** (Portland, Oregon)

    Research Assistant: [Project 10-9](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~warren/project10-9/), January 2007 -- August 2009

    - As a research assistant on [Project 10-9, an Open Voice Bridge](http://wiki.cs.pdx.edu/10-9/), I worked on a team to integrate [CMUSphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/) with an existing MS Access query tool. 10-9 is primarily developed using Java and Subversion.

* **Portland State University, Department of Computer Science** (Portland, Oregon)

    Computer Science Tutor, April -- December 2006
    - As a computer science tutor, I helped undergraduate students with primary courses including: compilers, data structures, and computational structures. Most questions were about representing data structures in C++ and functional programming in Standard ML.

* **Portland State University, Department of Civil Engineering** (Portland, Oregon)

    Graduate Research Assistant: [ITS Lab](http://its.pdx.edu/), January 2008 -- August 2009

    - As a graduate research assistant, I classiffied and discovered data gaps, automated daily discovery of erroneous readings, and began work on a time dependent view of overall transit system health. I primarily used PHP, SQL, and Haskell to discover and present the information.

* **Portland State University, Department of Civil Engineering** (Portland, Oregon)

    Undergraduate Research Assistant: [ITS Lab](http://its.pdx.edu/), November 2006 -- December 2008
    - As an undergraduate research assistant on the [Portland Oregon Regional Transportation Archive Listing (PORTAL)](http://portal.its.pdx.edu/Portal/index.php/home/) project, I created a web application displaying archived public transit system data on a Google map. I also helped process, aggregate, and query traffic data.
